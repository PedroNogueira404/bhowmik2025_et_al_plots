# Plots Builder

Automated pipeline to convert input data tables, FITS files, and radial profiles into:

- Individual plots of observations and models  
- LaTeX-ready figure grids with consistent formatting and grouping

## üìÑ Description

This tool was developed for generating plots for **ALMA Band 8**, high-resolution protoplanetary disks. It was created for **Bhowmik et al. 2025**, part of the **ODISEA** series.

> üìö The paper will be linked here once published.

The pipeline includes:

- Plot generation for individual disks
    - Three panel format: data, model and radial profile

- Sorting/grouping of figures by disk properties

- Automatic LaTeX `.tex` files for 2-column figure grids

## üß† Core Modules

These are the main Python modules:

1. `table_creator.py` ‚Äî prepares and reads the metadata  
2. `plotter_w_decorators.py` ‚Äî generates plots with relevant visual info  
3. `images_latex.py` ‚Äî creates LaTeX code with grids of plots  

All modules can be run in sequence via `main.py`.

## üöÄ How to Rename Modules and Call Them from Anywhere

To customize the module names and call the pipeline from any location:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project root:
   ```bash
   cd bhowmik2025_et_al_plots/
   ```

2. Inside this folder, open the `pyproject.toml` file and look for the section:
   ```toml
   [project.scripts]
   ```
   You‚Äôll find the default script names there (e.g., `np_table_creator`, etc.).  
   Rename them as you wish ‚Äî these names define the commands you‚Äôll use later.

3. Go to the source directory:
   ```bash
   cd src/bhowmik2025_et_al_plots/
   ```

4. Install the package in editable mode:
   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install -e .
   ```

Now, you can run the pipeline from anywhere with:
```bash
python3 -m bhowmik2025_et_al_plots
```

Or use the custom script name you defined in `[project.scripts]`, which maps to:
```bash
bhowmik2025_et_al_plots.__main__:main
```

You can also call the core modules individually by the names you defined.

> `bhowmik2025_et_al_plots/src/bhowmik2025_et_al_plots/`

> üìù A log file named `my_logs.log` will be created in the **current path** where you run the command. It records the latest execution and is **overwritten** if re-run from the same path.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The modules will break in the current version since the `input_files/` directory is not yet included. Once the paper is published and the data is pushed, everything will run as expected.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Plot Logic & Behavior

- **Plot order**:
  - If `png`: follows the index from `table.csv` 
  - If `pdf`: sorts by flux (low ‚Üí high) inside the given range

  > Example: Index `100`, and range: `0 - 100`  
  > - In PNG mode ‚Üí `ODISEA_C4_130`  
  > - In PDF mode ‚Üí `RA162813.74` (highest flux) of this sample

- **Plot Settings**:
  - Data: `vmin = rms_data`

  - Models:

    - Most: `vmin = 5%` of peak

    - Binaries: `10%`

    - Special cases: `1%` (e.g., `C4_41`, `C4_143`, `C4_51`)

  - Disks in Stage 0 or 1: Gaussian smoothing applied
  
    ```python
    scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter(data, sigma=0, mode="nearest")
    ```

  - `ODISEA_C4_094a` and `094b`: special treatment for model zoom  
    (black padding added where model is smaller than zoom window)

---

## üñºÔ∏è LaTeX Output Notes

- LaTeX `.tex` files are **only generated** if plots were saved as **PDF** (`dpi=600`).

  - Ensures scalability and high quality for grids.

- PNGs (`dpi=100`) are created **only** for debugging or quick inspection.

- If `images_latex.py` is executed **without** prior PDF generation, it will fail.
